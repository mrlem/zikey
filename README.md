So you just got a sweet little USB midi keyboard, but don't know what to install to play it? Or you've seen all those
complicated tutorial installing & connecting several tools together? But all you want, is just type your keyboard, and
some sound to come out...

**Zikey** might be what you're looking for:
 * run it
 * type on your **keyboard**
 * sound comes out of a **synthesizer**
 
 That's it.

_Please note that this software is a **work in progress**. It currently doesn't have a user-interface and doesn't allow
changing the instrument._
